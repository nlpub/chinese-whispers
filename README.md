# Chinese Whispers for Python

This is an implementation of the [Chinese Whispers](https://doi.org/10.3115/1654758.1654774) clustering algorithm in Python. Since this library is based on [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/), it is simple to use.

Given a NetworkX graph `G`, this library can [cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis) it using the following code:

```python
from chinese_whispers import chinese_whispers
chinese_whispers(G, weighting='top', iterations=20)
```

As the result, each node of the input graph is provided with the `label` attribute that stores the cluster label.

The library also offers a convenient command-line interface (CLI) for clustering graphs represented in the ABC tab-separated format (source`\t`target`\t`weight).

```shell
# Write karate_club.tsv (just as example)
python3 -c 'import networkx as nx; nx.write_weighted_edgelist(nx.karate_club_graph(), "karate_club.tsv", delimiter="\t")'

# Using as CLI
chinese-whispers karate_club.tsv

# Using as module (same CLI as above)
python3 -mchinese_whispers karate_club.tsv
```

A more complete usage example is available in the [example notebook](https://github.com/nlpub/chinese-whispers-python/blob/master/example.ipynb) and at <https://nlpub.github.io/chinese-whispers-python/>.

In case you require higher performance, please consider our Java implementation that also includes other graph clustering algorithms: <https://github.com/nlpub/watset-java>.
