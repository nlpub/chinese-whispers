Chinese Whispers for Python
===========================

This is an implementation of the `Chinese Whispers`_ clustering
algorithm in Python. Since this library is based on `NetworkX`_, it is
simple to use.

Usage
-----

Given a NetworkX graph ``G``, this library can `cluster`_ it using the
following code:

.. code:: python

   from chinese_whispers import chinese_whispers
   chinese_whispers(G, weighting='top', iterations=20)

As the result, each node of the input graph is provided with the
``label`` attribute that stores the cluster label.

The library also offers a convenient command-line interface (CLI) for
clustering graphs represented in the ABC tab-separated format
(source\ ``\t``\ target\ ``\t``\ weight).

.. code:: shell

   # Write karate_club.tsv (just as example)
   python3 -c 'import networkx as nx; nx.write_weighted_edgelist(nx.karate_club_graph(), "karate_club.tsv", delimiter="\t")'

   # Using as CLI
   chinese-whispers karate_club.tsv

   # Using as module (same CLI as above)
   python3 -mchinese_whispers karate_club.tsv

Miscellaneous

A more complete usage example is available in the `example notebook`_
and at https://nlpub.github.io/chinese-whispers-python/.
